# LSPs

Add LSPs to the `bin` directory and add the `bin` directory to your `$PATH` to enable LSPs to work (be sure to run `chmod +x` on the binaries to make them executable).

##### Add lsps directory to path
```
export PATH="$HOME/.emacs.d/lsps/bin:$PATH"
```

##### macOS Setup
```
brew install rust-analyzer
